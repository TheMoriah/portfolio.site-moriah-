            Koi is made to help the user complete goals and build habits for a
            healthier life. This was also an app designed through the Career
            Foundry's product design course. In this project, I created a fully
            prototyped app that includes 6 main fetures that help the user
            cultivate a healthy lifestyle.

              <h3>Problem &amp; Hypothesis</h3>
              <p>
                The user is not sure how to begin their health journey but knows
                they want to live a healthier lifestyle. Koi eliminates the
                growing pains of starting with guided goal plans and a focus on
                growth.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I believe that by creating well defined goals with small
                  tasks, the user will be more likely to accomplish the goal and
                  build a habit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe that having in app motivation that is linked to the
                  tasks that can be completed will encourage the user to work on
                  their goals.

                Meet Sam and Jordan. They are the types of users that I designed
                Koi for. They are both rather young individuals and have a
                willingness to keep up their health as they get older. They are
                both very familiar with technology and would have no trouble
                learning how to use Koi. Sam is interested in curating healthier
                habits into their life. Jordan wants working out to become one
                of his hobbies that helps him build his confidence and his
                muscles.

                The user flow is made to guide the user through preprogrammed
                steps towards their goals. Once the user signs in, they are
                brought to the pond, which acts as a dashboard, where they can
                see the goals they are working on. Then the user can choose the
                activity they want to do to complete the task.

                The low fidelity wireframes outlined the basic structure of the
                app. After revisions, I designed the first version of a high
                fidelity wireframe. This was the version I conducted usability
                tests on. Adjustment based on the usablity tests, peer review
                feedback, and mentor feedback led me to the final version of
                Koi.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Koi has developed into a unique app that I'm very proud of. An
              abundance of inspiration provided so many options for Koi to
              become the app that I envisioned. The most difficult part of the
              process was conducting the user research as I did not have a good
              sense of what information was helpful for a design. Using Figma
              was also a difficult part, as I only knew how to use the software
              in very basic and tedious ways. I gained a lot of experience
              through this project. Koi is a presentation of the many hard
              earned lessons I accumulated throughout this project.
